# Welcome to my personal website
Hello, my name is Eric Miao, an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto.
I like to make cool things using software and circuit hardware. 
I mainly maintain my portfolio on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ericmiao03/), 
but I  also  occasionally update [my website](https://MiaoE.github.io/).

This website is created using React.js and Tailwind CSS and deployed using GitHub Pages.
